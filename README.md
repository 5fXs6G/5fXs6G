## Hi there 👋🏻 
I'm interested in threat hunting, network security, and secure system engineering.

Check out my documentation site [TangledWeb.dev](https://tangledweb.dev) for some infosec tips and trick I've learn along the way as well as some of my hobby projects.

I'll continue to add new info regularly so I invite you to check back frequently if you find it interesting.
